# COIL 
*Case Outcome & Intervention Log*

COIL is an open-source CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built specifically for Interventional Radiology (IR) procedures logbook keeping.  It leverages the power of Google Sheets and Apps Script to provide a simple, yet effective way to manage and log your procedure records and track outcomes.

## Features

* **Simplified Procedure Records:** Easily record and manage case data, including ID, date, age, gender, symptoms, imaging findings, lab results, diagnosis, DSA findings, technical and clinical outcomes, and follow-up information.
* **CRUD Operations:**  Perform all essential database operations:
    * **Create:** Add new case records with ease.
    * **Read:**  View case data, search records, and filter results.
    * **Update:** Modify existing case records as needed.
    * **Delete:** Remove case records securely.
* **Google Drive Integration:**  Directly access case-specific folders in Google Drive with the click of a button.  Folders are automatically created if they don't exist. This integration is useful for saving anonymized radiological/clinical images.
* **Web App Deployment:**  Deploy COIL as a web app for easy access within your institution or practice.


## Patient Privacy Notice

COIL is designed with patient privacy in mind. The application *does not* store patient names to enhance data security.  Users are strongly advised to maintain a separate, secure, and access-controlled record linking patient IDs to their names offline.  This separation of identifiers helps protect patient privacy while still allowing for efficient case management within COIL.



## How to Use COIL

1. **Prerequisites:**
    * A Google account.
    * Basic familiarity with Google Sheets and Google Apps Script.

2. **Make Copies:**
    * **Google Sheet:** Create a copy of the provided COIL Google Sheet template.
    * **Apps Script:**  Make a copy of the provided COIL Apps Script file (`Code.gs`, `CSS.html`, `DataTable.html`, `FormPatientDetails.html`, `Index.html`, `JavaScript.html`, `SpinnerModal.html`).

3. **Configure Apps Script:**
    * **Open Script:** Open the copied Apps Script file.
    * **Update `SpreadsheetID`:**  In the `Code.gs` file, replace the placeholder value `YOUR_SPREADSHEET_ID` with the ID of *your* copied Google Sheet.  You can find the sheet ID in the URL of your Google Sheet.
    * **Update `DRIVE_FOLDER_NAME`:**  In `Code.gs`, set the `DRIVE_FOLDER_NAME` constant to the name you want to use for the parent folder in Google Drive where case folders will be created.
    * **Authorize the Script:** Run any function (like `doGet`) in the script. You'll be prompted to authorize the script to access your Google Sheet and Google Drive.

4. **Enable APIs:**
    * In the Apps Script editor, go to "Resources" > "Advanced Google services".
    * Enable the "Google Drive API" and the "Google Sheets API".


5. **Deploy as a Web App:**
    * In the Apps Script editor, go to "Deploy" > "New deployment".
    * Select "Web app" as the type.
    * Choose "Execute the app as:" "Me (your email address)".
    * Choose "Who has access to the app:" "(Your should prefer to keep it to - 'Only Myself'.)
    * Click "Deploy".
    * Copy the "Web app URL" â€“ this is the URL you'll use to access COIL.

6. **Using the App:**
    * Open the Web App URL in your browser.
    * You can now add, edit, delete, view, and search case records.
    * Click the "ðŸ“‚" button to access or create the corresponding Google Drive folder for a case.
